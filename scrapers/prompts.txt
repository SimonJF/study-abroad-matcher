# Course list scraper

Write a Python program that will take HTML like the HTML at the end of this message. The exact HTML should be a parameter to the program. The program should output JSON of the form:

{ name: <course name>, course_code: <course code>, url: <url for course page>}

Only give Python code, no explanation. Do not include the sample HTML in the generated program. Do not include sample usage code.

An example course is "Computer Systems". Each course links to a page that includes "unit.php"; if your program does not include 'unit.php' it is incorrect.

Here is the sample HTML:
